# Session Planner

This is the project that is used in the [Quick Start video](https://www.cuba-platform.com/learn/quickstart/studio/) for CUBA Platfrom framework. This tutorial shows 
three main things for creating any web application: how to design data model, how to manipulate data, 
how to create business logic and, finally, how to create a user interface. As an example, a simple, but fully 
functional version of an application that helps with session planning for a conference is created.
